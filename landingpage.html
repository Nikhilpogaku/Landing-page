            <h2>GENERALIZATION</h2>
            <p><ul>
              Generalization works in Bottom-Up approach.<br>
              <br>In Generalization, size of schema gets reduced.<br>
              <br>Generalization is normally applied to group of entities.<br>
              <br>Generalization can be defined as a process of creating groupings from various entity sets.<br>
              <br>In Generalization process, what actually happens is that it takes the union of two or more lower-level entity sets to produce a higher-level entity sets.<br>
              <br>Generalization process starts with the number of entity sets and it creates high-level entity with the help of some common features.<br>
              <br>In Generalization, the difference and similarities between lower entities are ignored to form a higher entity.<br>
            </ul></p>

            <h2>SPECIALIZATION</h2>
            <p>
              Specialization works in top-down approach.<br>
              <br>In Specialization, size of schema gets increased.<br>
              <br>We can apply Specialization to a single entity.<br>
              <br>Specialization can be defined as process of creating subgrouping within an entity set<br>
              <br> Specialization is reverse of Generalization. Specialization is a process of taking a subset of a higher level entity set to form a lower-level entity set.<br>
              <br>Specialization process starts from a single entity set and it creates a different entity set by using some different features.<br>
              <br>In Specialization, a higher entity is split to form lower entities.<br>
